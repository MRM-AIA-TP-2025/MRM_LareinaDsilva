The chatroom using ROS is a platform for users to communicate with more the one person at a time. It can contain any number of users. The chatroom created here is restricted to 3 users (3 nodes).In a chatroom each user should be able to send messages to other users as well as receive the messages sent by other users. Therefore each user(each node) is a publisher as well a subscriber.The message sent by one user is published to the topic and at the same time is displayed on the sender's console and is received (subscribed) by the other nodes and displayed on their console's as well. For this to happen an AsyncSpinner object was used allowing for a more responsive handling of incoming messages as it ensures that callbacks are processed asynchronously allowing for a more responsive handling of incoming messages. An AsyncSpinner is particularly useful when there are multiple callbacks that need to be processed concurrently.
The messages are published to and subscribed from a single topic called "chatter"(here). the ROS topic used in this chatroom is "chatter". A message called ChatMessage.msg was created under the msg folder inside the package "chatroom" which was then included in each node. The .msg file here is  used to inform the topic about the structure of the data(username and message--> both strings) being published.No services were used.
