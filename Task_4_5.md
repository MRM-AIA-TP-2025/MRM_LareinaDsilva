To complete task 4, git checkout -b Temp was used to create a new branch. Then Task_3.md file was created (on the terminal itself). git add . was used to stage it and git commit -m "Task_3 README file" to commit the changes. git push origin Temp was then used to push the new branch to remote. Then the pull request pop up was clicked followed by merge pull request, confirm merge, delete the temp branch. the branch was then switched to main by using the command git checkout main to push the Task_4_5.md README file.
